I've completely overhauled the blackjack game. It's now functional, although only single player. I hope to make it a lot better as time goes on.
Improvements that need to be made:
1. Better display of cards rather than the "list view"
2. Insert new deck before the deck is empty (currently, if all the cards are used, there's an error)
3. Double check rules around when dealer must hit or stay - and improve the logic.
4. Introduce Betting
5. The second dealer's card is - initially - supposed to be hidden (before bets are placed)
6. Split option
7. Multiplayer (my classes are already designed to allow for multiplayer)
8. Save "Players" and their money so they can accumalate "winnings" over multiple games.
